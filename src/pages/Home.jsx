                            Charles Aluminium, founded in 2005 by Engineer Chuks Cletus Eboson Igbojionu, was established with the mission of making
                            aluminium roofing sheets affordable for low-income households in Nigeria. The company began by specializing in short-span
                            aluminium sheets, introducing innovative roofing patterns to meet customer needs. Over time, it expanded its offerings
                            to include long-span aluminium sheets, leveraging Engineer Igbojionu’s extensive expertise gained over 23 years as a Production
                            Manager and Chief Engineer at one of Nigeria’s leading Aluminium Rolling Mills.
